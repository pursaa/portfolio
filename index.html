      <!--About Me-->

      <h2>All about me</h2>
      <p>I was born in New York but I have lived most of my life in the surrounding Seattle area.  I love to learn and seem to always find myself going to school or surffing the internet for information.  I always liked to make videos and editing photos.  I wanted to learn to create websites but I never had the time.  My husband died when my children were young leaving me to raise them alone.  I finally had time to ask myself what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I wanted to be a web designer so I started taking classes for graphic design three years ago.</p>
