      <!--About Me-->

      <h3>All about me</h3>
      <p>I was born in New York but I have lived most of my life in the surrounding Seattle area.  My husband died leaving me to raise our children by myself.  I never really knew what I would love to do as a career.  I went to classes for electronics and was in that field for a while but my bosses always pushed me to be the leader of teams so I ended up being was a supervisor most of the time.  I spent time troubleshooting to component level and build/fixing computers. I love to learn and seem to always find myself going to school or surffing the internet for information.  I always liked to make videos and editing photos.  I wanted to learn to create websites but I never had the time. I finally had time and started taking graphic design classes three years ago. I only have two courses left for my AA.  I guit my 40 hour a week job in 2016 so I could focus more time on my classes and got my licence as a care giver.  Now I work part time as a care giver helping those that need help and going to classes the reast of the time. I felt I needed more programming experiance so I signed up at Epicodus to really learn coding.</p>
